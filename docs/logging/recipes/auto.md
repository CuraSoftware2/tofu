## Autogenerated logging
You can automatically generate log messages stating when the method of some service has been entered and left.
```scala
@derive(representableK, loggingMid)
trait MyService[F[_]]{
  def makeThis: F[Unit]
  def makeThat(arg1: Int, arg2: String): F[Long]
}

object MyService extends LoggingCompanion[MyService]{
  
  def make[F[_]: Logs.Make: Monad]: MyService[F] = {
    val core = new Impl[F]
    core.attachLogs
  }
  
  class Impl[F[_]: Monad] extends MyService[F]{
    //implementation
  }
}
```


## Your own specific logs

tofu.logging allows you to use your own backend for logs, e.g. to send them to Clickhouse.
To do this you'll need to implement `Logs` trait. The rest is still handled by tofu.

Let's say you have this clickhouse client:
```scala
trait ClickhouseClient[F[_]]{
  def send[A](data: A): F[Unit]
  def initTable(name: String): F[Unit]
}
```
You'll need to implement only one method to create Logs:
```scala
def clickhouseLogs[F[_]](client: ClickhouseClient[F])(logs: Logs[F, F]) = 
  new Logs[F, F] {
      def byName(name: String): F[Logging[F]] = 
        for {
        _ <- client.initTable("logs")
        logging = logs.byName(name)
      } yield logging //todo how tf to implement this nicely?
  }
```
